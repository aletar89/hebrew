This directory needs image files for the Hebrew reading app, following this naming convention:

1. Hebrew letter name followed by a number and image extension:
   - Examples: aleph1.png, aleph2.jpg, beth1.webp, gimel1.svg, etc.

Supported image formats: png, jpg, jpeg, gif, svg, webp, and other standard web image formats

The app supports the following Hebrew letter names:
- aleph (א)
- beth (ב)
- gimel (ג)
- daleth (ד)
- he (ה)
- vav (ו)
- zayin (ז)
- heth (ח)

- samekh (ס)
- ayin (ע)
- pe (פ)
- tsadi (צ)
- qoph (ק)
- resh (ר)

Examples:
- aleph1.png - An image starting with the letter א (Aleph), e.g., a picture of אבא (father)
- aleph2.jpg - Another image starting with א, e.g., a picture of אריה (lion)
- beth1.webp - An image starting with the letter ב (Beth), e.g., a picture of בית (house)

The app will automatically detect available images and only use letters that have corresponding images.
You can add multiple images for each letter (using different numbers), and the app will randomly select them during gameplay.

The images should be clear, child-friendly illustrations that a 4-year-old can easily recognize.
